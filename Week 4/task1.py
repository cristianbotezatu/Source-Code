#this line was wrong as input takes string but this variable is integer
#Current statement saves the input as int
radius = int(input("Radius: "))

#this statement saves 3.14 value in x variable
x = 3.14

#this statement saves the value of variable x in variable pi
pi = x

#this statement saves the area using the x and radius variables
area = pi * radius ** 2

#printing area
print(area)
