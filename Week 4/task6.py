#declaring adding data type is not necessary in python
#therefore, int has been removed
x = 2

#the first letter should be small letter p
#the string "squared is" should be closed in double quatation (")
print (x, "squared is", x * x)

#to show x cubed two (*) is needed not three
xcubed = x ** 3

#this statement prints xcubed
print(x, "cubed is", xcubed)
